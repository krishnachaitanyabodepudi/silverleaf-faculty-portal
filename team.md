# Team Reflection

Throughout the semester, the team gained experience in AI product development, research synthesis, and ethical evaluation. We learned the importance of transparency, stakeholder alignment, and responsible AI deployment. Collaborative design helped refine our solution while balancing innovation with feasibility. The project strengthened our understanding of how AI can shape higher education responsibly.
