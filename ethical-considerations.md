  <h1 class="section-title">Ethical & Social Considerations</h1>
  
  <p>Ethical thinking was part of our project from the very beginning. Since we are using AI in an academic environment, we made sure our design respects fairness, privacy, and transparency at every stage.</p>
  
  <div class="info-box">
    <h3 class="subsubsection-title">Bias Mitigation</h3>
    <p>All AI-generated feedback is reviewed by faculty before being shared with students. This keeps grading fair and prevents the AI from making decisions on its own.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="info-box">
    <h3 class="subsubsection-title">Transparency</h3>
    <p>Whenever AI assists in generating feedback or responses, the system makes it clear. Faculty always know which parts came from the model and which parts were added manually.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="info-box">
    <h3 class="subsubsection-title">Privacy Protection</h3>
    <p>To keep student data safe, we support running the AI locally using <strong>LM Studio</strong>, which ensures that submissions and text never leave the university's environment. No external data sharing occurs during local execution.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="info-box">
    <h3 class="subsubsection-title">Accessibility</h3>
    <p>We kept the interface clean and straightforward so both faculty and students can use it comfortably, regardless of technical experience. The portal design supports inclusive access for different user needs.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="info-box">
    <h3 class="subsubsection-title">Compliance</h3>
    <p>The system design aligns with important academic and legal frameworks, including <strong>FERPA</strong>, <strong>GDPR</strong>, and Silver Leaf University's internal AI policy. This ensures our solution remains responsible and institution-ready.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Overall, the portal incorporates fairness, accountability, and explainability into the way it works, making the use of AI supportive — not risky — in a real academic setting.</p>
