# Problem Context & Stakeholders

## Problem Statement

Faculty members at Silverleaf University face challenges in efficiently managing their teaching responsibilities. The current system lacks integration, requiring faculty to use multiple disconnected tools for course management, scheduling, syllabus creation, and student interaction. This fragmentation leads to time inefficiency, inconsistent information across platforms, limited support for routine tasks, and poor user experience with outdated interfaces.

## Current Challenges

### Challenge 1: Fragmented Systems
Faculty members must navigate multiple separate systems for different tasks:
- Separate platforms for timetable management
- Different tools for syllabus creation and storage
- Disconnected curriculum information systems
- No centralized dashboard for overview

**Impact**: Increased cognitive load, time waste, and potential for errors

### Challenge 2: Manual Administrative Tasks
Many routine tasks require significant manual effort:
- Manual grade calculation and feedback generation
- Time-consuming lesson plan creation
- Repetitive syllabus formatting and organization
- Manual schedule coordination

**Impact**: Reduced time available for actual teaching and student interaction

### Challenge 3: Lack of Intelligent Assistance
No AI-powered support for:
- Generating constructive feedback
- Creating lesson plans and educational materials
- Answering course-related questions
- Providing contextual assistance based on course content

**Impact**: Faculty must rely solely on their own knowledge and experience without technological augmentation
