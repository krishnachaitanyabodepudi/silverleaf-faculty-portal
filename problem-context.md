  <h2 class="subsection-title">The Challenge</h2>
  
  <p>Silver Leaf University is modernizing its academic infrastructure. Faculty spend significant time on administrative tasks, grading, and course preparation. Students need timely feedback and clear guidance. Administrators must balance innovation with compliance and governance.</p>
  
  <p>Traditional systems lack AI tools that understand course-specific content. Generic solutions don't align with individual course structures, syllabi, or rubrics. The university needs a solution that integrates AI into academic workflows while maintaining educational standards and regulatory compliance.</p>
