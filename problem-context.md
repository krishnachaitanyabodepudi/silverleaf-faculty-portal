  <h1 class="section-title">Problem Context & Stakeholders</h1>
  
  <p>Faculty at Silverleaf University manage increasing academic expectations while navigating new teaching technologies. Many feel overwhelmed by administrative tasks, unclear workflows, and the lack of AI systems trained specifically on their syllabi and course structures. Students require consistent guidance, timely feedback, and structured academic support. Administrators must manage compliance, content governance, and institutional AI adoption.</p>
  
  <p>Universities are also under pressure to modernize digital infrastructure, deliver AI-enabled learning experiences, and maintain competitive academic programs while ensuring responsible governance.</p>
