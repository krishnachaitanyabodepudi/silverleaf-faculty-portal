  <p>Our research used EDUCAUSE, Gartner, Ithaka S+R studies, and Deloitte's AI in Education reports. Key findings:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Students increasingly depend on AI for study assistance</li>
    <li>Automated feedback saves faculty significant time</li>
    <li>Universities must ensure governance, explainability, and policy alignment</li>
    <li>Ethical issues include data privacy, bias mitigation, and transparency</li>
    <li>Conversational AI can support learning if aligned with curriculum</li>
    <li>Academic institutions prefer internal or private AI models for security</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>We examined market tools like Cognigy and Kore.ai to understand workflow automation, but our academic problem required a custom-built syllabus-aligned system.</p>
