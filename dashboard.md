<div class="content-section">
  <h1 class="section-title">Dashboard & Data Analysis</h1>
  
  <p>Our dashboard is designed to give a quick, straightforward view of what's happening inside each course. We didn't overcomplicate it — the goal was to help faculty and students find the most important information without clicking through multiple screens.</p>
  
  <h2 class="subsection-title">What You Can See on the Dashboard</h2>
  
  <div class="info-box">
    <h3 class="subsubsection-title">Assignments Overview</h3>
    <p>Faculty can see all assignments created for their courses at a glance.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="info-box">
    <h3 class="subsubsection-title">Submission Status</h3>
    <p>The dashboard shows how many students submitted, who is pending, and whether any submissions were late.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="info-box">
    <h3 class="subsubsection-title">AI Feedback Visibility</h3>
    <p>Whenever Gemini generates draft feedback for a PDF submission, faculty can quickly spot which assignments already have AI feedback and which ones still need review.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="info-box">
    <h3 class="subsubsection-title">Student View</h3>
    <p>Students get a clean timeline of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upcoming deadlines</li>
      <li>Past submissions</li>
      <li>Course announcements</li>
      <li>Feedback (AI + faculty review)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <h2 class="subsection-title">Why the Dashboard Matters</h2>
  
  <p>Instead of jumping between emails, PDFs, or multiple URLs, everything related to a course is visible in one place. This saves time for faculty and reduces confusion for students.</p>
  
  <h2 class="subsection-title">Live Portal (Vercel Deployment)</h2>
  
  <p>You can explore the working portal here:</p>
  
  <a href="https://faculty-portal-mrp.vercel.app" class="dashboard-link" target="_blank">🔗 Live Prototype: Faculty Portal</a>
  
  <p>This live link demonstrates the entire workflow — assignments, submissions, dashboard analytics, and the AI features we built into the platform.</p>
