# Executive Summary

The **Silverleaf University Faculty Portal** is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to revolutionize faculty management and enhance the teaching experience at Silverleaf University. This project addresses the critical need for an integrated, intelligent platform that streamlines administrative tasks, supports pedagogical activities, and leverages artificial intelligence to assist faculty members in their daily responsibilities.

The portal provides a centralized platform for managing courses, schedules, syllabi, and curriculum information, eliminating the need for multiple disconnected tools. Built with modern web technologies including React 18 with TypeScript, Node.js with Express, and integrated with Google Gemini API, the system offers an intuitive, responsive interface that adapts to various devices and user needs.

Key features include a home dashboard with overview of courses, students, and recent activity; class timetable management with weekly schedule view and add/edit/delete functionality; comprehensive syllabus management with learning objectives, outcomes, and grading breakdown; curriculum overview for exploring academic programs and course requirements; and an AI-powered assistant that provides context-aware assistance for grading, lesson planning, and course management.

The AI assistant, powered by Google Gemini, can generate draft grades and constructive feedback, create lesson outlines and quizzes, utilize syllabus and curriculum context for course-specific assistance, and answer questions about teaching methodologies and course management. The system maintains conversation history and supports uploading syllabus content and grading rubrics for enhanced context.

The application uses TailwindCSS with a custom color scheme featuring Silverleaf colors (various shades of slate) and accent colors (blue, green, purple, orange) for different features, ensuring a responsive design for all screen sizes. The backend API provides RESTful endpoints including POST `/api/chat` for AI assistant interactions and GET `/api/health` for server health status.

This portal is expected to significantly improve faculty productivity by reducing time spent on administrative tasks, enhancing the quality of course materials through AI-assisted generation, and providing better organization and access to academic resources. The system's intuitive design and AI capabilities position it as a valuable tool for modern educational institutions, demonstrating mastery of full-stack development, AI integration, and user-centered design principles.
