    <p>Silverleaf University is preparing for a major shift in how its faculty operate by introducing AI-powered tools and updated teaching technologies. As the Modern Research Pioneers (MRP) team, we focused on building a solution that helps faculty feel more confident using AI while also easing their workload. Our idea is a support portal that offers syllabus-aligned AI Faculty Support tools that assist with grading, class preparation, and quick academic assistance through a conversational AI trained specifically on Silverleaf University's content.</p>
    
    <p>Through research, system design analysis, and academic insight, our project aims to save faculty time, increase support efficiency, and help the university adopt a responsible, scalable, AI-ready academic ecosystem. The solution addresses operational challenges by aligning course design with AI models, delivering fast feedback to students, and providing faculty with structured and customizable AI support.</p>
    
    <p>The system integrates the Gemini API for cloud-based AI and LM Studio for private local inference to ensure secure, policy-compliant usage. Our platform represents a modern and ethical approach to AI-powered academic support—balancing innovation, governance, transparency, and educational value.</p>
