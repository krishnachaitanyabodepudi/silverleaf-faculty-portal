- Students increasingly depend on AI for academic support, often using AI tools for studying and clarification.  
- Institutions face strong pressure to adopt AI responsibly while maintaining governance and compliance.  
- Automated feedback tools significantly improve grading efficiency and faculty workload.  
- Ethical concerns such as transparency, bias mitigation, and data privacy consistently rank as top priorities. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
