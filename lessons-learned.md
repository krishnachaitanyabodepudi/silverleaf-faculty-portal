  <p>Throughout this semester, our team got hands-on experience with real AI product development — not just the technical side, but also the research, design, and ethical thinking that go into building an academic tool. We realized very early that supporting faculty with AI isn't just about writing code. It requires trust, clear communication, and a design that respects how instructors actually work.</p>
  
  <p>Working together helped us refine our ideas, test different approaches, and find a balance between what is innovative and what is actually practical. We also learned that good technology decisions come from understanding real user needs — not from following trends.</p>
  
  <p>Overall, this project gave us a stronger appreciation for how AI can responsibly support higher education when it's designed carefully, transparently, and with the end users truly in mind.</p>
