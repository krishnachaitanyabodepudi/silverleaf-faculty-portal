## Executive Summary

Silverleaf University is preparing for a major shift in how its faculty operate by introducing AI-powered tools and updated teaching technologies. As the Modern Research Pioneers (MRP) team, we focused on building a solution that helps faculty feel more confident using AI while also easing their workload. Our idea is a support portal that offers syllabus-aligned AI Faculty Support tools that assist with grading, class preparation, and quick academic assistance through a conversational AI trained specifically on Silverleaf University’s content. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Our research and system design centered around saving faculty time, increasing personalized support, and keeping academic material aligned with university standards. The goal is not only to improve daily teaching efficiency but also to strengthen engagement and help the university adopt a more modern, AI-ready academic environment. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Through interviews, research insights, and academic analysis, we discovered strong demand for AI tools that support grading, clarity, transparency, and student learning. Institutions are under pressure to adopt AI responsibly, and faculty need tools that improve workflows while maintaining ethical and regulatory standards.

Our final portal provides assignment management, course alignment, AI feedback assistance, a course-aware chatbot, and structured academic architecture. The project demonstrates how AI can support faculty while maintaining transparency, fairness, and data protection.
