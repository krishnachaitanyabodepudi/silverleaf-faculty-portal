## Executive Summary

The **Silver Leaf University Faculty & Student Portal** is a unified academic management system built to streamline key workflows for Admins, Faculty, and Students. The platform brings together course management, assignment submission, communication, and AI-powered support in one centralized portal.

**Admins** can create courses and assign them to specific faculty members.  
**Faculty** can log in to view all their assigned courses, post new assignments, track student submissions, publish announcements, and respond to student messages through an integrated mailbox system.  
**Students** can view enrolled courses, check assignment deadlines, submit their work as PDFs, read announcements, and communicate directly with faculty or support.

A major highlight of the portal is its **AI integration** powered by the **Google Gemini API**. The system includes:  
- **Course-Aligned AI Assistant** that answers student and faculty questions related to a specific course’s syllabus and content.  
- **AI Feedback Analyzer** that reviews student submissions and provides the **first level of automated grading feedback**, helping faculty save time and maintain consistency in evaluation.

The portal is built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **shadcn/ui** for a modern and responsive user interface. All data—such as faculty profiles, course details, assignments, announcements, and student submissions—is stored in structured JSON datasets designed for this Master’s Research Project. Uploaded submissions are processed as PDFs, with extracted textual content analyzed through the Gemini API for feedback generation.

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end academic workflow platform supported by clean UI design, structured data modeling, assignment tracking, and AI-powered grading tools tailored for Silver Leaf University.
