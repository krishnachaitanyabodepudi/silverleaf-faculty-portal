## Executive Summary

Silver Leaf University currently manages courses, assignments, announcements, and student communication through disconnected systems such as email threads, shared drives, spreadsheets, and isolated LMS exports. These scattered workflows create delays, reduce clarity, and make it difficult for faculty, students, and administrators to maintain consistent visibility into academic progress.

Our project presents a unified **Faculty & Student Portal** designed to consolidate these processes into a single, role-based platform. Faculty receive a structured view of all their courses, can create and manage assignments, track submissions, publish announcements, and communicate directly with students through an integrated mailbox. The system also includes an **AI-powered Feedback Analyzer** using Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, enabling faculty to generate quick, high-quality feedback summaries from student submissions.

Students benefit from a simplified dashboard showing enrolled courses, assignment deadlines, submission history, announcements, and a built-in messaging channel to reach faculty or support. All submissions are uploaded as PDFs, automatically stored alongside extracted text for analysis and indexing.

The portal is built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **shadcn/ui**, with structured JSON datasets that act as a lightweight database for the purposes of this Master's Research Project. This architecture demonstrates end-to-end integration of UI, data storage, file handling, and AI-driven analysis.

Overall, this project shows how universities can transition from fragmented processes to a centralized digital experience that improves faculty productivity, enhances feedback quality, and provides students with a more transparent and consistent academic workflow.
