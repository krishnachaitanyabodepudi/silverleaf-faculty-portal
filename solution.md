# Proposed Solution

Our solution is the **AI Faculty Support Portal**, a conversational and academic workflow system trained on Silverleaf’s syllabus, rubrics, and university policies. It provides faculty with practical, day-to-day support while keeping everything aligned with academic standards. Key features include: :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

- Automated feedback assistance for grading  
- A course-aligned AI chatbot  
- Class preparation support (examples, materials, teaching strategies)  
- Assignment creation and management  
- Student submission tracking  
- Admin role for course assignment and faculty management  

The workflow supports both **Gemini API** and **local LM Studio** setups. Model sizes range from 4B–180B parameters, depending on performance needs. This ensures privacy by keeping all data and prompts on the laptop unless cloud execution is required. Faculty always retain final control for grading and evaluation. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
